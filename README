Lingua-AR-Word version 1.51
======================

This is a dictionary from Arabic to another language:
for every word coming from the input file, these modules are able to take out the stem, look for the translation according to the stem and exporting the whole dictionary DB in HTML or LaTeX.
In order to work on a DB, you will need the Lingua::AR::Db module.
If you'd only want the stem of a word or its ArabTeX translitteration, no other modules are needed.

Main features are:
->finding the stem, which is accomplished by chopping away all the prefixes and suffixes, and by some characters removal at the end.
->exportation. This is a real good thing for Arabic students like me, so that I may easily memorize the meaning of a stem. This way, the finding the translation of a word while translating "on-the-fly" will be easier and faster.

All the vocabulary databases are located in a particular folder, so that these files may be directly modified without any harm to the script execution.
Moreover I'm working on an importation module, so that new stems/terms may be added easily and quickly to the local database.
